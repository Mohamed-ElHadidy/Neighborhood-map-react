# Neighborhood map Project [FEND 8th project]

## Project Overview

A single page application featuring a map  of eight musuems in Alexandria,Egypt
by using the Google maps api for loading the and the locations data by Four square api.

## TL;DR

To get started right away:

* Download it from [Here](https://github.com/Mohamed-ElHadidy/reactnd-project-myreads-starter/archive/master.zip) *OR* Clone it from 

```
https://github.com/Mohamed-ElHadidy/reactnd-project-myreads-starter.git
 ```

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.


## Deployment

`npm run build` creates a `build` directory with a production build of the app. Set up your favorite HTTP server so that a visitor to your site is served `index.html`, and requests to static paths like `/static/js/main.<hash>.js` are served with the contents of the `/static/js/main.<hash>.js` file.
The service worker works only in production build.

### Static Server

For environments using [Node](https://nodejs.org/), the easiest way to handle this would be to install [serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve) and let it handle the rest:

```sh
npm install -g serve
serve -s build
```
